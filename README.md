# Vilius Ivanovas

I like programming, mostly for school, a bit for personal use. <br>
I have some [cool projects](https://github.com/ViliusIvanovas/Bad-Apple-CSharp), check them out! I have a [GitHub Page](https://viliusivanovas.github.io/) (WIP). <br>
I program in C#, HTML and CSS, am still new in all. Would like to learn Python, C and C++. <br>
